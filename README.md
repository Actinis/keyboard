# Actinis Remote Keyboard

![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.actinis.remote/keyboard)

A custom keyboard view library designed for internal use within the [Actinis Remote](https://actinis.io) project.

Built using **Compose Multiplatform**.

## Features in Progress

The following features are planned for future development:

- Layout variants (e.g., email, URL)
- Autocomplete support
- Theming support
- iOS and macOS support

## Important Note

This project is an **early-stage MVP** and represents a small, non-critical component of a much larger MVP initiative.

As such, the current codebase prioritizes rapid prototyping over production-level quality. For now, you should not expect:

- Perfect or polished architecture
- Full adherence to SOLID principles or a clean architecture
- Comprehensive documentation
- RTL support
- Unit or integration tests
- Full portability (e.g., tablet support)

Contributions and feedback are welcome, but please keep the project's early-stage nature in mind.
